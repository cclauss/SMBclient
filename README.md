Access Samba/Windows-Shares<br/>
=========================<br/>
<br/>
Small ui example: upload/download/rename/delete files or make/remove directories. Use at your own risk, this worked with my mini wifi router usb share. I'm not responsible for data loses (please always backup your data:).<br/>
<br/>
First you need to download the impacket python module: impacket-0.9.12.tar.gz<br/>
Then extract \impacket-0.9.12\impacket\ to the side-packages directory.<br/>
And you also need a copy of ntpath.py in your side-package directory.<br/>
